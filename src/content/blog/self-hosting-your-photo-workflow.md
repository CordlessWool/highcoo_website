title: "Why I Self-Host My Photo Workflow"

I wanted independence.

When you control your own infrastructure, no one can hold you hostage. No surprise price hikes, no changed terms, no "we're shutting down."

That's not a rant against cloud software — I'm a developer myself, I know the effort that goes into building good software. Some of it is excellent. But for something as personal as a photo library, I wanted it on my terms.

## What self-hosting actually means

Self-hosting means running software on hardware you control — a VPS, a home server, a Raspberry Pi in a corner. The software stores your data where you tell it to. You can back it up. You can move it. You own it.

For something as personal as a photo library, this matters more than people realize.

## The subscription trap

I'm not opposed to paying for software. I pay for tools I use every day. But the model where you pay monthly and lose everything if you stop — that's a bad deal for any long-term archive.

Most photographers aren't making money from their photos. They share because they care about the work. Paying monthly just to keep that accessible — and losing it when you stop — doesn't make sense.

If you think tools like Highcoo should exist and stay free, consider [supporting the project](https://github.com/sponsors/CordlessWool). It keeps development going.

## What Highcoo does differently

Highcoo runs wherever you have a server. The data is yours — standard files on a filesystem, no proprietary format. If you ever want to stop using it, your photos are still there, still organized, still accessible.

The goal was never to lock anyone in. It was to make the step from "edited" to "published" faster and less annoying, for as long as you want to use it.

That's why Highcoo will stay open source forever.

## Getting started

If you want to try it, check the [setup guide](/blog/getting-started-with-highcoo). The [demo](https://pasture.highcoo.studio) gives you a feel for the interface before you commit to anything.

Your photos are worth keeping. They deserve infrastructure that's worth keeping too.
