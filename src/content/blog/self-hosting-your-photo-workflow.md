Three months after launching Highcoo, I want to write down something that's been rattling around in my head: the case for self-hosting your creative tools.

This isn't a rant against cloud software. Some of it is genuinely excellent. But I've watched too many photographers lose access to years of organized work because a service raised prices, changed terms, or simply shut down. That shouldn't happen.

## What self-hosting actually means

Self-hosting means running software on hardware you control — a VPS, a home server, an old laptop in a corner. The software stores your data where you tell it to. You can back it up. You can move it. You own it.

For something as personal as a photo library, this matters more than people realize.

## The subscription trap

I'm not opposed to paying for software. I pay for tools I use every day. But the model where you pay monthly and lose everything if you stop — that's a bad deal for any long-term archive.

Photography is a long-term archive. The shots from five years ago are still worth keeping.

## What Highcoo does differently

Highcoo runs wherever you have a server. The data is yours — standard files on a filesystem, no proprietary format. If you ever want to stop using it, your photos are still there, still organized, still accessible.

The goal was never to lock anyone in. It was to make the step from "edited" to "published" faster and less annoying, for as long as you want to use it.

## Getting started

If you want to try it, the [setup guide](/blog/getting-started-with-highcoo). The [demo](https://pasture.highcoo.studio) gives you a feel for the interface before you commit to anything.

Your photos are worth keeping. They deserve infrastructure that's worth keeping too.
