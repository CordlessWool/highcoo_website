It started on a winter day, helping a friend figure out how to finally publish her photos. We'd just come back from photographing highland cows—beautiful shots, full of personality. But like so many photographers, those images were sitting on a hard drive, gathering digital dust.

I looked for tools that could help. Something to bridge the gap between editing and publishing. Nothing felt right. Everything was either too complex, subscription-based, or focused on the wrong problems.

So I built Highcoo.

## What Highcoo does

Highcoo is a self-hosted backend for managing your photo library. It's designed for photographers who want to:

- **Organize with tags, not folders** — Find any photo instantly, create collections on the fly, select in bulk.
- **Apply watermarks consistently** — No more manual edits or forgotten protection.
- **Own their workflow** — Self-hosted, open source, no subscriptions.

It's not trying to replace Lightroom or Capture One. Those are editing tools. Highcoo is what happens *after* editing—when you need to actually get your photos out into the world.

## What's next

Highcoo is still early. The core is solid: tagging, filtering, bulk operations, watermarking. But there's more to come.

If you're a photographer who's tired of the gap between "edited" and "published," give it a try. Check out the [demo](https://demo.highcoo.studio), read the [docs](https://docs.highcoo.studio), or grab the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/CordlessWool/highcoo).

Your photos deserve to be seen.
