It was December, one of those rare winter days where the sun actually shows up and the snow is bright underfoot. We drove to the edge of Berlin, where a small herd of highland cows lives on a pasture. They're not shy — you watch them, they watch you back, completely unbothered. I tried not to disturb them, just stood there watching them move through the snow, eating dry leaves from the trees, drinking from frozen water.

She took beautiful shots. The kind that hold a moment forever.

But slowly, as winter turned, those snowflakes began converting into dust on a hard drive. Beautiful photos, unseen.

It wasn't that she hadn't edited them — she had. The problem came after. Getting from Lightroom to somewhere people could actually see them meant figuring out watermarking, organizing which shots were shareable, uploading, tagging for her website. Each step small enough to skip. All of them together: enough friction to just... not.

I went looking for something that could help. What I found was either sprawling software trying to do everything, or cloud services asking for a monthly fee to store someone else's photos on someone else's server.

So I built Highcoo.

## What Highcoo solves

Highcoo is a self-hosted backend for managing your photo library. It's not trying to replace Lightroom or Capture One — those are editing tools. Highcoo is what happens after editing, when you need to actually get your photos out into the world.

- **Organize with tags, not folders** — Find any photo instantly, create collections on the fly, select in bulk.
- **Apply watermarks consistently** — No more manual edits or forgotten protection.
- **Own your workflow** — Self-hosted, open source, no subscriptions.

## What's next

Highcoo is still early. The core is solid: tagging, filtering, bulk operations, watermarking. But there's more to come.

If you're a photographer who's tired of the gap between "edited" and "published," give it a try. Check out the [demo](#), read the [setup guide](#), or grab the code from [GitHub](#).

Your photos deserve to be seen.
